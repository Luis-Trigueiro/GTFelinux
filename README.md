# Grand Theft Felinux (GTF)
2020

Our first group project which took part in our 4th week at <Academia de Código_> #49 Bootcamp @Aveiro. 

### The idea
We received a challenge about creating a game in Java within a week, so we had a brainstorm session to decide the concept of the game.
The game revolves around a cat burglar that wants to steal a milk bottle from a cow. 
Our protagonist loses stamina as time passes, so he must eliminate other cats to restore lifes, he can also use female cats as checkpoints.

### The Development
Prior to coding, we drew out a Class Diagram with everything we wanted in the game.
We set priorities on what was needed to make a complete game, since we had a lot of ideas for features, organization was key.
Everyday we would make a list of the objectives and a list of problems/bugs to fix and each member would be asked which one they wanted to take part in.

### Tech && Methodologies
